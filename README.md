The goal of this homework is to predict whether the answer to a trivia question is correct or not.
Thus, it is a binary classification problem. You will have to train effective classification models,
but the more important (and effective) route for success is to engineer features and gather additional data to help your predictions.

About the Data:
Quiz bowl is an academic competition between schools in English-speaking countries; hundreds
of teams compete in dozens of tournaments each year. Quiz bowl is different from Jeopardy, a
recent application area. While Jeopardy also uses signaling devices, these are only usable
after a question is completed (interrupting Jeopardy's questions would make for bad television).
Thus, Jeopardy is rapacious classification followed by a race---among those who know the
answer---to punch a button first.
